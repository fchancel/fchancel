Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florian, a Front End Developer with a focus on Vue.js and TypeScript. I enjoy creating user-friendly and engaging web experiences.

Aside from front end development, I have experience in Back End Development using Python and FastAPI, which allows me to develop well-rounded web applications.

Feel free to explore my repositories to get a glimpse of my work and collaborations.

If you'd like to connect or chat, reach out to me on LinkedIn. I'm always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
